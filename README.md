# Maths Visualised

Project URL: https://michaelcychan.github.io/maths-visualised/  

This projects is created for me to teach kids about prime numbers, factors, multiples (and maybe even more in the future). Clicking on the number grid will automatically show factors and multiples, hopefully the visualisation can help understanding.

The project uses React framework and TypeScript.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `npm run predepoly`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Create a new branch for publishing on GitHub Pages.
